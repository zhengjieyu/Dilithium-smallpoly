It contains our source code for Dilithium with parallel small polynomial multiplication algorithmï¼ˆthe algorithm 9 in subsection 3.3 of paper) optimized for both C reference implementation and Arm Cortex-A72 neon implementation. We use the codes for evaluation in section 5.

# Installation

## Cloning the code
Clone the code 

```
git clone https://github.com/zhengjieyu/Dilithium-smallpoly.git
```

## C reference implementation code

### Hardware Configuration

- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU at 2.3GHz(16 GB memory) with TurBo Boost and Hyperthreading disabled. 

### Software Version
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Linux Kernel 4.4.0
- gcc  9.4.0
- openssl
### Install GCC

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-9
```
### Install openssl
```
sudo apt-get install openssl
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

To compile C reference code, go to the C_reference_implementation directory,  for example, for Dilithium-3, go to the subdirectory dilithium3-smallpoly, run

```
make
```
This produces the executables 

```
test/test_dilithium3
test/test_speed3
```
The first executable is used for verifying correctness of code, the second is for benchmark.

Run 

```
./test/test_dilithium3
./test/test_speed3
```
to see the tests results
## Arm neon implementation code

### Hardware configuration

- Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi  4 Model B) with ARMv8-A instruction sets, Cortex-A72(1.8 GHz) CPU and 4GB RAM, it also supports ARMv8-A Neon SIMD instructions.

### Software Version
- Ubuntu 21.04
- gcc 10.3.0
- openssl
It is essential that you are running a 64-bit OS to be able to execute aarch64 code.
The 64-bit Raspbian OS can be used, but we have not tested all code with it.

### Install GCC

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-10 g++-10
```

The Makefiles included in this repo assume that you are natively compiling your
code using gcc. 



## Benchmarking on Cortex-A72
To compile the test programs, go to the Arm_Neon_implementation directory, run
```
sudo make speed 
sudo make all
```
This produces the executables 

```
test/test_speed2_test2
test/test_speed3_test2
test/test_speed5_test2
test/test_dilithium2
test/test_dilithium3
test/test_dilithium5
```
The first three executables are used for benchmark, the following three executables are used for verifying correctness of code.
Run

```
sudo ./test/test_speed2_test2
sudo ./test/test_speed3_test2
sudo ./test/test_speed5_test2
sudo ./test/test_dilithium2
sudo ./test/test_dilithium3
sudo ./test/test_dilithium5
```
to see the tests results.
